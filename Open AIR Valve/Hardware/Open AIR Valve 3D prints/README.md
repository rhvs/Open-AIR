# What's New in Version 3.1

Version 3.1 introduces major mechanical improvements focused on reliability, ease of assembly, and reduced material usage.

## Sensor System Improvements

- Completely redesigned sensor mounting mechanism for improved accuracy and reliability.
- New sensor housing is approximately 50% smaller, reducing material usage and improving compactness.
- Sensor housing now includes alignment features, allowing easier positioning.

## Housing Structure Improvements

- The housing is now split into two halves, significantly improving structural strength.
- Both housing halves now include integrated cable protection channels, preventing cables from being pinched or damaged between the housing and ventilation box.

## Material Optimization

- Infill reduced from 15% to 5%, resulting in:
  - Significant plastic savings
  - Faster print times
  - Lower overall production cost
  - No reduction in required structural strength due to improved geometry

## Mechanical Motion Improvements

- Valve rotation is now mechanically limited to approximately 90 degrees
- Prevents over-rotation, which previously could:
  - Stress mechanical parts
  - Reduce lifespan
  - Cause incorrect positioning

This results in more reliable and predictable valve operation.

## Software Enhancements

Version 3.1 also introduces several software improvements, including:

- Improved homing reliability
- Better position control
- Increased operational safety
- Additional configurable features

(See the firmware documentation for full details.)

# Previous Versions

## Version 1.0 — Initial Release

- First working design
- Used an Omron mechanical switch for homing detection
- Functional but included moving mechanical contact parts subject to wear

## Version 2.0 — Hall Sensor Upgrade

- Replaced mechanical switch with a Hall-effect sensor
- Provided:
  - Contactless operation
  - Increased reliability
  - Reduced wear and maintenance
  - Improved positional accuracy

---

# Summary

Version 3.0 represents a significant improvement over previous versions, offering:

- Stronger and more reliable housing
- Smaller and easier-to-install sensor system
- Lower material usage
- Improved cable protection
- Mechanical safeguards against over-rotation
- Enhanced firmware capabilities

These improvements make the Open AIR Valve more robust, efficient, and easier to manufacture and assemble.
